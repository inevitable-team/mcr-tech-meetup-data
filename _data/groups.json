Typically our events include a 45 minute talk or panel followed by 'lean coffee' style agenda-less discussions.\n\nFood and drink are provided, usually by the host or a sponsor.\n\n**What we are not about**\nRecruitment, vendor pitches & knowledge declaration. The group will be a safe place to discuss experiences and ideas. With this in mind, we’d prefer no recruiters take part with the intent to source clients and that vendors don’t do pitches at our events.\n\nSponsors are of course welcome, but the notoriety and thanks are what we can offer.\n\n**Code of conduct**\nTL;DR: Be nice, understanding and helpful.\n\n1. I am an attendee at DevOps Manchester, learning from and sharing with other DevOps Manchester attendees in an effort to better myself and my industry. I co-create the experience with fellow attendees. I am prepared to give my energy, presence and sensitivity to creating the best possible experience for myself and others.\n2. I am coming to DevOps Manchester to interact with people. I understand that imagery and language which is suggestive or derogatory will offend and make people uncomfortable. I also understand that people may have boundaries and sensibilities different from my own. I will accept without question when informed that something is offensive or unacceptable in the context of the DevOps Manchester event.\n3. I will never intentionally harass or offend another attendee regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, size, race or religion and will not abide another attendee being harassed or offended. If I am aware that anyone is uncomfortable or unsafe, I will notify those giving offence and the DevOps Manchester event organisers.\n4. If I am offended or harassed, I will inform people around me who make me feel safe and the event organizers. If I feel safe, at my discretion, I will inform those giving offence of the specific actions with the hope that the other party is well-intentioned and ignorant, but I am under no obligation to do so.\n5. I understand that people are different and I attempt to be forgiving of others actions at the level of their sincere intent, but my priority is protecting my safety and the safety of others. I will act without hesitation or reservation until there is no question of the safety of all parties.\n6. I trust the DevOps Manchester organisers and attendees will co-create the best possible experience for everyone involved, as I will.\n\n**Talk guidelines**\nTalks that tell a story are often the most popular, so please share your experiences and encourage discussion.","city":"Manchester","country":"gb","state":"18","zip":"M2 5DB","created":1384444556000,"lat":53.48,"lon":-2.25,"members":2206,"banned":0,"ratingTotal":0,"ratingAverage":0,"topic_ids":["87614","126177","166000","15167","18865"],"category_id":"546","organizer":{"id":"856274811","name":"Elwyn C."}},{"id":"19059079","name":"Manchester Startup Ecosystem by StartupBlink","link":"https://www.meetup.com/startupblink-manchester","urlname":"StartupBlink-Manchester","description":"<p>Do you want to meet like-minded entrepreneurs?

We meet once a month (on the 2nd Thursday), provide ample time for networking, and showcase 2-4 women/non-binary in data speakers who talk about their career paths, role models, challenges faced and data projects that they work on. We also conduct masterclasses a few times each year on topics such as CV writing, interviewing techniques and salary negotiation to empower women to progress in data roles.\n\n[HER+Data](http://herplusdata.org/) is a space where everyone can share their stories and develop. We're volunteer driven so we keep our events simple and informal. There will be great content, laughter and a room full of data women and non-binary people from various backgrounds.

An employee that is looking to jump into entrepreneurship\\, but would prefer to buy a business as opposed to starting one from scratch?\n2\\. Have a relative or friend who wants to sell you their business\\, but you do not have the capital to transact?\n3\\. Already own business but organic growth is too slow and painful and you want a faster growth trajectory by buying out your competitor?\n[Testimonials from previous attendees](https://www.perryanderson.global/events)\n**The host of this event:**\nPerry M. Anderson is a Private Equity investor and Oxford MBA, who founded a private equity firm in 2002. He lives between homes in London and Vancouver. Perry has taught this material to hundreds of people globally on how to buy and sell businesses for a living - without having to risk any of your own capital in order to transact. Recently he has published his book *\"Red to Black - The Art of Corporate Turnaround\".*\n**Perry Anderson:** \"I have completed over 30 investments in the past 19 years - all using my own capital. After 2 decades worth of experience in deal-making, I have come to realize that the capital to do deals does not have to come from your own pocket, as the alternative finance markets are awash with capital. I can show you how to access this!\"\n[More about Perry Anderson](https://www.perryanderson.global/about)\nSo, what would you learn?\n**How to source a business?** Without using Brokers or Intermediaries to have a constant flow of deals that fit your specific parameters and interests.\n**How to structure a 'win-win' offer?** Deals only work when both parties gain. Using creative deal structures, Perry will show you how to get to a win-win.\n**How to fund business for sale and close the deal?** Using private capital (from the alternative capital markets) and creative financing without the need to use any of your own personal capital.\n**How to buy a profitable business for $1?** Perry recently acquired a profitable chain of well established retail stores for $1. The business was turning over $1.7M in consistent revenue. Mindset and structuring was key to this transaction Perry will show you *exactly* how this was done step-by-step. This deal structure can easily be copied and replicated - and is a simple deal structure to get a deal over the line quickly. \n**How to conduct due diligence and closing?** Legals and accounting are an integral part of any transaction. Perry will show you how to get this done efficiently and how to have the company pay for these expenses...not you!\n**How to fix the company?** Whether a company is distressed or profitable, there will be areas of the business that need fixing. Perry has some really clever and proven tactics that you can implement immediately that will have a significant impact on the cash flow of the business. More urgently, when you cannot make payroll next week, what do you do? These are vital tactics for any down economic market. \n**How and when to use a Merger?** This is the fastest way to build and grow a company. Think going from zero to 10 million in 10 months...not in 10 years! Most entrepreneurs build businesses the wrong way....\n**How to quickly sell a company when there is a limited buyer pool?** Strategies on how and when to sell the business for 6 or 7 figure sums. Perry will share how he quickly sold a Media company he acquired (when there were very few buyers) and how Perry maximized his exit.\nAdditional real-world 'street-fighting' tactics that are ***NOT taught in any MBA program*** or global business schools. This is a highly transferrable skill set and after this workshop, you will have all the 'tools' to be able to go out and do this yourself.\n*You will also leave the workshop with Contracts, Templates and Documents from actual deals done.* \n*You can then use these to replicate on your own deals.* \n*You will also be given a detailed list of **Perry's private 'non-bank' funders** (UK, US and Canada) and their direct contact details.* The value of this is priceless! \nHave more questions? \n**Please contact Davide at:**\n*davide@perryanderson.global*\n\nPS: There is no sales pitch at this workshop and nothing is being sold to you - just pure knowledge exchange!","city":"Manchester","country":"gb","state":"18","zip":"M2 5AS","created":1548080911000,"lat":53.48,"lon":-2.25,"members":377,"banned":0,"ratingTotal":0,"ratingAverage":0,"topic_ids":["23925","17381","35073","19120","14266","16855","16856","17390","70985","70286","30609","724292","16924","108403","16621"],"category_id":"405","organizer":{"id":"221933657","name":"Maxime A."}},{"id":"36931687","name":"Manchester AI","link":"https://www.meetup.com/manchester-ai","urlname":"manchester-ai","description":"Manchester AI is a new & exciting in person event within the city centre.

You get support on how to organize great B.U.I.L.D events by experienced business event organizers.</p>\n<p>Please note: Free events = free support, paid events = agreed profit share on a case to case basis.</p>\n<p><b>The history of B.U.I.L.D</b></p>\n<p>B.U.I.L.D is a brand by EntAnon (short for Entrepreneurs Anonymous). In 2015 more than 30 thought provoking events were organized by EntAnon and B.U.I.L.D (that is at least one event every second week) engaging thousands of members. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The name Entrepreneurs Anonymous could stand for being addicted to Entrepreneurship and having an urgent need to get group support for it. But actually Entrepreneurs Anonymous is more about providing a safe place with like-minded people where entrepreneurship can be explored. Here Entrepreneurs-to-be and undercover entrepreneurs from corporates have been spotted too.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs Anonymous events started in Dublin, Ireland in 2011 as accountability group by former students of an entrepreneurship course. The interest for the group grew and now social events with guest speakers are organized every last Tuesday of the month. With a membership increase by 10% each month it was quickly realized last Tuesday-events were simply just not enough for the Anonymous Entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;was set up to offer more opportunities for Entrepreneurs to learn from each other. So far&nbsp;B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events like the Gigonomy Panel discussion, Speed Business Networking and the Free Business Clinic have been organized. B.U.I.L.D also organizes former DDM events. These are events for people especially interested in Data Driven Marketing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>More about B.U.I.L.D and DDM Alliance</b></p>\n<p>EntAnon's brand&nbsp;​​B.U.I.L.D partnered&nbsp;​ with the former Data Driven Marketing Alliance (DDM). Future ​DDM&nbsp;​meetups and other events in Copenhagen, Berlin, Belgium, Dublin,&nbsp;Dusseldorf, Helsinki, London, Manchester, Netherlands, Paris,&nbsp;Stockholm, ​soon ​Milano​ and other parts of Europe will be organized together with B.U.I.L.D. DDM representatives​ can&nbsp;​set up online events​ ​(webinars and conferences) and&nbsp;use the B.U.I.L.D. groups around Europe ​as ​​a channel.&nbsp;If another B.U​.​I​.​L​.​D or EntAnon​ ​event is set on the same date the organizers agree​ ​on the next best date for the&nbsp;DDM&nbsp;Alliance event to take​ ​place.</p>","created":1386749022000,"city":"Manchester","untranslated_city":"Manchester","country":"GB","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom","localized_location":"Manchester, United Kingdom","region2":"Greater Manchester","state":"18","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":53.48,"lon":-2.24,"members":470,"member_pay_fee":false,"wepay_fee_deprecated":true,"organizer":{"id":"565973266","name":"Matt L."},"who":"Business B.U.I.L.Ders","lang":"en_US","group_photo":{"id":443066645,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/1/5/highres_443066645.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/1/5/600_443066645.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/1/5/thumb_443066645.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"key_photo":{"id":443066645,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/1/5/highres_443066645.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/1/5/600_443066645.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/1/5/thumb_443066645.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"Europe/London","category":{"id":2,"name":"Career & Business","shortname":"career-business","sort_name":"Career & Business"},"meta_category":{"id":522,"shortname":"career-business","name":"Career & Business","sort_name":"Career & Business","photo":{"id":450131927,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/9/7/highres_450131927.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/9/7/600_450131927.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/9/7/thumb_450131927.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"category_ids":[2]},"removed":true,"removedNotedAt":"2024-03-22T11:43:20.638Z"},{"id":30324397,"name":"NUX UK","status":"active","link":"https://www.meetup.com/NUX-UK/","urlname":"NUX-UK","description":"<p>We’re a group of enthusiasts who like to get together to talk about anything and everything to do with the user experience – sharing knowledge, sparking ideas and supporting each other.</p>\n<p>We’re non-charging, non-profiteering, non-egomaniacal, friendly, normal people who like informal, sociable meetings that give us something to think about.</p>","created":1539628333000,"city":"Manchester","untranslated_city":"Manchester","country":"GB","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom","localized_location":"Manchester, United Kingdom","region2":"Greater Manchester","state":"18","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":53.48,"lon":-2.23,"members":363,"member_pay_fee":false,"wepay_fee_deprecated":true,"organizer":{"id":"481125527","name":"Napoleon G."},"who":"Members","lang":"en_US","group_photo":{"id":476145332,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/1/4/highres_476145332.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/1/4/600_476145332.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/1/4/thumb_476145332.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"key_photo":{"id":475477916,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/4/1/c/highres_475477916.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/4/1/c/600_475477916.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/4/1/c/thumb_475477916.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"Europe/London","category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"tech","sort_name":"Tech"},"meta_category":{"id":292,"shortname":"tech","name":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech","photo":{"id":450131949,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/d/highres_450131949.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/d/600_450131949.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/d/thumb_450131949.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"category_ids":[34]},"removed":true,"removedNotedAt":"2024-03-22T11:43:20.638Z"},{"id":30504212,"name":"Launch Your Business: Business Strategy & Marketing","status":"active","link":"https://www.meetup.com/launch-your-business/","urlname":"launch-your-business","description":"<p>Have you got a business idea you want to launch but you're unsure how?</p><p><br /></p><p>We're all about building a strong community of entrepreneurial people.

I am in charge or arranging events for the tenants that suit their professional needs. I want to create an event that mixes different types of people from around the city. The days of working 9-5 are no longer always the norm and I would really love to bring different freelancers together on a weekly location.</p> \n<p>I really like the idea of a Freelance Friday where we can grow this event. To help with this I have approached Ziferblat to grow a network of independent workers at a 25% discount. The event will be open to the public – which could be students, freelancers and personal study/research. </p> \n<p>Ziferblat is very centrally located, right in the heart of the Northern Quarter so would be the perfect place to break out after the freelancing event to enjoy a beverage – this is the reason I have chosen the date of the event to take place on a Friday. </p> \n<p>The event itself would mean everyone gets support and advice from other people who freelance and can socialize with people from different background and working sectors.</p> \n<p>I could also negotiate more perks with Ziferblat to ensure repeat attendance for the event – things like 20% discount for the event rooms if they wish to use. Also providing free printing too which can be a hassle in the city. </p> \n<p>I want the event to be super relaxed for everyone in attendance so they can come in and just enjoy the space and the people around them.</p>","created":1566292268000,"city":"Manchester","untranslated_city":"Manchester","country":"GB","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom","localized_location":"Manchester, United Kingdom","region2":"Greater Manchester","state":"18","join_mode":"approval","visibility":"public","lat":53.48,"lon":-2.25,"members":74,"member_pay_fee":false,"wepay_fee_deprecated":true,"organizer":{"id":"695589692","name":"Rose P."},"who":"Members","lang":"en_US","key_photo":{"id":492266450,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/7/5/2/highres_492266450.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/7/5/2/600_492266450.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/7/5/2/thumb_492266450.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"Europe/London","category":{"id":2,"name":"Career & Business","shortname":"career-business","sort_name":"Career & Business"},"meta_category":{"id":522,"shortname":"career-business","name":"Career & Business","sort_name":"Career & Business","photo":{"id":450131927,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/9/7/highres_450131927.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/9/7/600_450131927.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/9/7/thumb_450131927.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"category_ids":[2]},"removed":true,"removedNotedAt":"2024-03-22T11:43:20.638Z"},{"id":28782038,"name":"The Inclusion Coalition","status":"active","link":"https://www.meetup.com/The-Inclusion-Coalition/","urlname":"The-Inclusion-Coalition","description":"<p>The Inclusion Coalition is a community of organisations and individuals in Greater Manchester that is working to improve diversity and inclusion within the tech sector.</p> \n<p>We will use our collective knowledge and our community to collate our knowledge, interrogate the sector, run campaigns, create tools and ultimately help each other improve.</p> \n<p>We want to facilitate more robust and successful digital outcomes across the sector by creating a more diverse workforce.</p> \n<p>Find out more at <a href=\"https://theinclusioncoalition.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://theinclusioncoalition.com</a></p>","created":1528709952000,"city":"Manchester","untranslated_city":"Manchester","country":"GB","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom","localized_location":"Manchester, United Kingdom","region2":"Greater Manchester","state":"18","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":53.48,"lon":-2.25,"members":73,"member_pay_fee":false,"wepay_fee_deprecated":true,"organizer":{"id":"53693814","name":"Ellsworth C."},"who":"Members","lang":"en_US","key_photo":{"id":471946473,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/5/8/9/highres_471946473.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/5/8/9/600_471946473.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/5/8/9/thumb_471946473.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"Europe/London","category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"tech","sort_name":"Tech"},"meta_category":{"id":292,"shortname":"tech","name":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech","photo":{"id":450131949,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/d/highres_450131949.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/d/600_450131949.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/a/d/thumb_450131949.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"category_ids":[34]},"removed":true,"removedNotedAt":"2024-03-22T11:43:20.638Z"},{"id":34857756,"name":"Manchester Online Business Startup Group","status":"active","link":"https://www.meetup.com/manchester-business-startup-group/","urlname":"manchester-business-startup-group","description":"<p>Let's meet-up online and learn how to adopt the best internet money-making strategies for 2021!</p>\n<p>The internet is now the number one source for clients of businesses.
